This is a simple Web application that demonstrates integration of Spring Social and Spring Security.

This is targeted at developers who already have an existing application using Spring Security, who
want to add in Spring Social. Spring Social allows new users to sign in using their social network
accounts. This app shows how to integrate that process into your existing sign up/in processes.
Spring Social also allows existing users to connect their local accounts to their social network
accounts. This app shows how to provide that functionality to existing users.


What is included in this app:

User - local user account
UserDAO - for saving users and looking users up by username
SocialUser - a user's account in a social network (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)
SocialUserDAO - data access methods useful for implementing Spring Social's
    ConnectionRepository and UsersConnectionRepository interfaces
